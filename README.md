## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I'm a mobile developer focused on building beautiful, responsive, and high-performance cross-platform applications using Flutter. With a strong eye for design and a passion for creating smooth user experiences, I use Flutter and Dart to develop apps that run seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices. This repository is a reflection of my journey, where I explore new concepts, share code, and build projects that push my skills forward.

Flutterâ€™s expressive UI toolkit and fast development cycle make it my go-to choice for creating visually rich and interactive mobile apps. I enjoy working with both Material and Cupertino widgets to craft native-feeling experiences, while also leveraging custom animations and transitions to make apps feel fluid and engaging.

My focus extends beyond visualsâ€”Iâ€™m also interested in app architecture, state management (such as using Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc), and performance optimization. I take pride in writing clean, modular code that is easy to test, maintain, and scale. I'm always learning more about best practices for mobile development, including accessibility, offline capabilities, and platform-specific integrations.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find a mix of complete app projects, reusable widgets, UI experiments, and contributions to open-source tools. Whether itâ€™s a to-do list app, a weather dashboard, or a more complex application with API integrations, each project is built with attention to detail and a desire to improve with every line of code.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, collaboration, and connecting with others in the Flutter community. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something here thatâ€™s useful, inspiring, or just fun to build on.
